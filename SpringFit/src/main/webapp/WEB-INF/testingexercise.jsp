    <h1>Testing</h1>
    
    <p>Thinking there might be an exercise page, with a drop down menu that allows a user to filter by exercise type (arms, legs, etc.)</p>
	<p>Page might also have a "show all" button</p>
	<p>Maybe each exercise has a checkbox/radial button, that will allow the user to add all into one of their workouts, or create a new workout</p>
