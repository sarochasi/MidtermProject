# **MidtermProject**

## **Overview**

Our groupâ€™s midterm project SpringFit, is a Java web application that demonstrates fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JPA and Spring MVC, along with user athentication and session tracking.

Using JPA and Spring MVC, SpringFit allows a user to create an account, log in, build personalized workouts, and interact with the community by liking and commenting on their workouts. Users can also log their weight and basic nutritional data, and view a list of those logs.

### **Methodologies Used:**
- Agile (Software Development) - Flexibility, collaboration, customer satisfaction.
  - GitHub Branching
    - 1. Pull latest remote main into local main.	`git pull origin main`
	- 2. Branch from updated local main.	`git checkout -b myBranch`
	- 3. Work in local branch, committing frequently.
	- 4. When ready to merge, pull remote `main` into local branch (must commit first) `git pull origin main`
	- 5. Fix any merge conflicts, then commit.
	- 6. Push to remote branch. `git push origin myBranch`
	- 7. Create pull request.
	- 8. Merge pull request.
